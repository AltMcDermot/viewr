Instant Portfolio for Photographers.

I tried keeping it simple:
Drop images into assets folder
Make a headline.txt file and drop it into the options folder if you want to add a site headline(or your name)
Make a email.txt file and drop it into the options folder if you want to add your email address.
The current site is responsive, and uses masonry to keep things neat.
